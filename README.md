# Popular-Sorting-Algorithms-compared
In this program I have manually implemented numerous sorting algorithms in C++ and then plotted average performence in Pythons Matplot library.
Sorting Algorithms tested include:
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Bubble Sort with Escape Clause 
- Insertion Sort
- MergeSort
- QuickSort
